Dust has been known to affect cloud growth, but it probably has little to do with the cloud pattern observed here.","ground_truth":"Cloud formation processes differ significantly between the tropical rainforests of Madagascar and the coast of China due to the varying temperatures of land and ocean. In Madagascar, ample moisture from the tropical rainforest allows for cloud formation as sunlight heats the land, causing moist air to rise and cool, leading to condensation and cloud development. Conversely, along the coast of China, the ocean does not heat up as much as land, resulting in cool, moist marine air that gives rise to dense clouds over the ocean. However, when these clouds move onshore, they tend to evaporate due to the warmer, drier land, leaving only a cloud layer that traces the coastline."}
