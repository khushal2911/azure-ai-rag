What happen off Vancouver Island in August 2016?,"['58\n\nTeeming Life in the Strait of Georgia Canada\n\nIn August 2016, the waters off of British Columbia turned bright green. The Strait of Georgia and nearby inlets were teeming with\n\ncoccolithophores—a harmless type of floating plant-like organisms called phytoplankton. Coccolithophores have chalky, scale-like\n\nshells made of calcium carbonate. The milky-white color of those shells can brighten and discolor otherwise blue waters when the\n\nplankton explode in such massive blooms.\n\nWhile coccolithophore blooms occasionally occur off the west coast of Vancouver Island, few scientists could recall seeing a bloom\n\nlike this in the strait. Research suggests that coccolithophore numbers have been increasing in recent decades even as the water\n\nhas been growing more acidic.']","In August 2016, the waters off of British Columbia, including those near Vancouver Island, turned bright green due to massive blooms of coccolithophores, a type of phytoplankton.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

In the north, the ocean overtops the coral.\n\nAlong the southern rim of this atoll, shallow water appears aquamarine. Water darkens to navy blue as it deepens toward the\n\ncentral lagoon.
