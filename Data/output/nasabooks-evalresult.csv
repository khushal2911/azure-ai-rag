Teeming Life in the Strait of Georgia
Canada

In August 2016, the waters off of British Columbia turned bright green. The Strait of Georgia and nearby inlets were teeming with 

coccolithophores—a harmless type of floating plant-like organisms called phytoplankton. Coccolithophores have chalky, scale-like 

shells made of calcium carbonate. The milky-white color of those shells can brighten and discolor otherwise blue waters when the 

plankton explode in such massive blooms. 

While coccolithophore blooms occasionally occur off the west coast of Vancouver Island, few scientists could recall seeing a bloom 

like this in the strait. Research suggests that coccolithophore numbers have been increasing in recent decades even as the water 

has been growing more acidic.=================

Double Trouble
Pacific Ocean

The island of Hawaii rarely takes a direct hit from a hurricane. In August 2016, two Pacific storms almost changed that.

The Suomi NPP satellite observed Hurricanes Madeline and Lester stirring up the central Pacific Ocean as category 3 and 4 storms 

while moving northwest toward the Hawaiian Islands. The tight, deep eye of category 3 Hurricane Madeline (right) appears almost 

three-dimensional even in a two-dimensional satellite view. Lester (next page) showed off an equally menacing eye. The bright 

streaks across the ocean surface are areas of sunglint, where sunlight reflected directly back at the image.

Ultimately, the storms blew just south and north of the islands without making landfall. In fact, no hurricane has made landfall on the 

Big Island since recordkeeping started in 1949. Only 15 hurricanes have passed within 200 nautical miles of the island in that time.=================

Valley Fog
Canada

Fog is essentially a cloud lying on the ground. Like all clouds, it forms when the air reaches its dew point—the temperature at  

which an air mass is cool enough for its water vapor to condense into liquid droplets.

This false-color image shows valley fog, which is common in the Pacific Northwest of North America. On clear winter nights, the 

ground and overlying air cool off rapidly, especially at high elevations. Cold air is denser than warm air, and it sinks down into the 

valleys. The moist air in the valleys gets chilled to its dew point, and fog forms. If undisturbed by winds, such fog may persist for 

days. The Terra satellite captured this image of foggy valleys northeast of Vancouver in February 2010.","In August 2016, the waters off of British Columbia, including those near Vancouver Island, turned bright green due to massive blooms of coccolithophores, a type of phytoplankton.",5,5,The RESPONSE is fully grounded as it accurately conveys all essential information from the CONTEXT without introducing unsupported details or omitting critical points.,pass,3,4,4,"The first context chunk is directly relevant to the query about what happened off Vancouver Island in August 2016, while the other chunks are irrelevant.

- The atoll supports a diverse marine ecosystem, with hard and soft corals thriving throughout the reef, and a unique habitat created by the shallow aquamarine waters and deeper navy blue central lagoon.

Coral Cocos
Indian Ocean

Coral atolls—which are largely composed of huge colonies of tiny animals such as cnidaria—form around islands. After the islands 

sink, the coral remains, generally forming complete or partial rings. The South Keeling Islands, part of the Cocos Islands in the Indian 

Ocean, are such a place.

Only some parts of the South Keeling Islands still stand above the water surface. In the north, the ocean overtops the coral. 

Along the southern rim of this atoll, shallow water appears aquamarine. Water darkens to navy blue as it deepens toward the 

central lagoon. Above the water line, coconut palms and other plants form a thick carpet of vegetation. Hard and soft corals thrive 

throughout the reef.=================

Storms Stir Up Sediment
Bermuda

In October 2014, the eye of Hurricane Gonzalo passed right over Bermuda. In the process, the potent storm stirred up the sediments 

in the shallow bays and lagoons around the island, spreading a huge mass of sediment across the North Atlantic Ocean. This 

Landsat 8 image shows the area after Gonzalo passed through.

The suspended sediments were likely a combination of beach sand and carbonate sediments from around the shallows and reefs. 

Coral reefs can produce large amounts of calcium carbonate, which stays on the reef flats (where there are coralline algae that also 

produce carbonate) and builds up over time to form islands.

Storm-induced export of carbonates into the deep ocean—where they mostly dissolve—is one of the ways that the oceans naturally 

balance the addition of atmospheric carbon dioxide to ocean waters.=================

Making Tracks
Pacific Ocean

Ships steaming across the Pacific Ocean left this cluster of bright cloud trails lingering in the atmosphere in February 2012. The 

narrow clouds, known as ship tracks, form when water vapor condenses around tiny particles of pollution from ship exhaust. The 

crisscrossing clouds off the coast of California stretched for many hundreds of kilometers from end to end. The narrow ends of the 

clouds are youngest, while the broader, wavier ends are older.

Some of the pollution particles generated by ships (especially sulfates) are soluble in water and can serve as the seeds around which 

cloud droplets form. Clouds infused with ship exhaust have more and smaller droplets than unpolluted clouds. As a result, light 

hitting the ship tracks scatters in many directions, often making them appear brighter than other types of marine clouds, which are 

usually seeded by larger, naturally occurring particles like sea salt.=================

Remote Rupert Bay is a place where the majesty and dynamism of fluid dynamics is regularly on display. With several rivers pouring 

into this nook of James Bay, the collision of river and sea water combines with the churn of tides and the motion of currents to make 

swirls of colorful fluid.

As they wind through the boreal forests and wetlands of northern Quebec, the rivers that flow into Rupert Bay carry water stained 

brown with natural chemical substances found in plants. Tannins and lignins from roots, leaves, seeds, bark, and soil can leach into 

the water and give it a yellow, brown, or even black color. (The same process gives tea its dark color.) Note that the colored plumes 

and intricate vortices around the islands are pointing inland—an indicator that the tide was likely coming in, or that northwesterly 

winds were affecting the flow of the water.=================

Ephemeral Lake Frome
Australia

The interior of Australia is full of ephemeral lakes. These basins pass most of their time as salt pans, but occasional heavy rains can 

fill them with water. 

The Earth Observing-1 satellite captured this image in April 2010 after water had flowed into Lake Frome, which stands at the 

southern end of an arc of salt pans. When it fills, the waters usually come from precipitation in the hills and other salt pans upstream. 

The land to the east has a slightly higher elevation and consists of a network of dry river channels. Inside the salt pan, the land 

surface is uneven. Areas shaped like sloppy teardrops rise above the surrounding plain. Water on the surface appears in shades of 

dull green. And throughout much of Lake Frome, water makes its presence known not through standing water but through mud or 

wet salts. Darker surfaces show where water has seeped through typically dry sediments.=================

Channel Country
Australia

Australia’s Channel Country is full of hundreds of channels, as the Georgina, Burke, and Hamilton rivers merge into the very broad 

floodplain of Eyre Creek. The land is flat and the drainage is poor, which encourages semi-permanent wetlands to form at the 

meeting points of the rivers.

These wide floodplains in Queensland are unique on the planet. Scientists think they are caused by the extreme variation in water 

and sediment discharges from the rivers. In many years there is no rainfall at all, and the rivers are effectively non-existent. In years 

of modest rainfall, the main channels will carry some water, sometimes spilling over into narrow water holes known as billabongs.

Every few decades, the floodplain carries extremely high discharges of water. For instance, tropical storms to the north can lead 

to great water flows that inundate the entire width of the floodplain. On such occasions, the floodplain appears as series of brown 

and green water surfaces with only tree tops indicating the location of the islands. Such is the case in this image taken from the 

International Space Station in September 2016.","When rivers flow into James Bay, the collision of river and sea water combines with the churn of tides and the motion of currents, creating swirls of colorful fluid.

How do coastal weather patterns in China relate to wind visualization as seen in cloud streets over Brazil and Bolivia?,"- Coastal weather patterns in China feature onshore winds that carry cool, moist marine air from the ocean towards the land.
- These winds can give rise to dense clouds; however, the warmer and drier conditions on land generally lead to the evaporation of these marine clouds.
- As a result, clouds tend to leave a layer that traces the coastline instead of forming over the land (source: page-33.pdf).

- In Brazil and Bolivia, the wind is visualized through cloud streets formed when humid air rises and condenses into cumulus clouds due to cooler air above, aligning parallel to the wind direction (source: page-11.pdf).

Summary: Coastal weather patterns in China involve marine air that leads to cloud formation near the coastline but evaporates over warmer land. In contrast, Brazil and Bolivia illustrate how wind can be visualized through cumulus cloud streets that indicate wind direction and intensity.

Curving Cloud Streets
Brazil and Bolivia  

To the human eye, the wind is invisible. It can only be visualized by proxy, by its expressions in other phenomena like blowing leaves, 

airborne dust, white-capped waters—or the patterns of clouds.

Acquired in June 2014 by the Aqua satellite, this image shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it 

appeared in the early afternoon. As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that 

humid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds. 

Cumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind. 

Usually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high-pressure weather systems, 

as they did here.=================

Bering Streets
Arctic Ocean

Winds from the northeast pushed sea ice southward and formed cloud streets—parallel rows of clouds—over the Bering Strait in 

January 2010. The easternmost reaches of Russia, blanketed in snow and ice, appear in the upper left. To the east, sea ice spans 

the Bering Strait. Along the southern edge of the ice, wavy tendrils of newly formed, thin sea ice predominate.

The cloud streets run in the direction of the northerly wind that helps form them. When wind blows out from a cold surface like sea 

ice over the warmer, moister air near the open ocean, cylinders of spinning air may develop. Clouds form along the upward cycle in 

the cylinders, where air is rising, and skies remain clear along the downward cycle, where air is falling. The cloud streets run toward 

the southwest in this image from the Terra satellite.","Coastal weather patterns in China demonstrate how onshore winds carry cool, moist marine air that forms dense clouds over the ocean.

"How does moisture contribute to cloud formation over land compared to the ocean, as seen in the examples from China and Madagascar?","- Over the ocean, cool, moist marine air leads to dense cloud formation. However, when this marine air moves onshore towards warmer, drier land, the clouds tend to evaporate, resulting in a cloud layer that traces the coastline (China example) (page-33.pdf).
  
- In contrast, over land, such as in Madagascar, ample moisture and warmed air from the land promote cloud formation. Sunlight heats the moist air, causing it to rise, cool, and condense into water droplets until clouds form. This process occurs over land where air is ascending and does not occur over the river where air is descending (page-45.pdf). 

Summary: Moisture contributes to cloud formation over the ocean through cool, moist air leading to dense clouds, but these clouds may evaporate over warmer land. Conversely, over land, especially in places with ample moisture like Madagascar, warmed moist air ascends and condenses, leading to cloud formation.","TITLE: page-33.pdf, CONTENT: A

there is ample moisture for cloud formation. Sunlight heats the land all day, warming that moist air and causing it to rise high into the 

atmosphere until it cools and condenses into water droplets. Clouds generally form where air is ascending (over land in this case), 

but not where it is descending (over the river). Landsat 8 acquired this image in January 2015.=================

Riding the Waves
Mauritania

You cannot see it directly, but air masses from Africa and the Atlantic Ocean are colliding in this Landsat 8 image from August 2016. 

The collision off the coast of Mauritania produces a wave structure in the atmosphere. 

Called an undular bore or solitary wave, this cloud formation was created by the interaction between cool, dry air coming off the 

continent and running into warm, moist air over the ocean. The winds blowing out from the land push a wave of air ahead like a  

bow wave moving ahead of a boat. 

Parts of these waves are favorable for cloud formation, while other parts are not. The dust blowing out from Africa appears to be 

riding these waves.

How do coastal weather patterns influence cloud formation over the Bering Strait?,"Coastal weather patterns influence cloud formation over the Bering Strait in the following ways:

- Northeasterly winds push sea ice southward, creating cloud streets, which are parallel rows of clouds, over the Bering Strait.
- These cloud streets develop because when wind blows out from the cold surface of the sea ice over warmer, moister air near the ocean, it can cause cylinders of spinning air to form.
- Clouds build along the upward cycles in these cylinders where air rises, while clearer skies are often found where the air is descending (source: page-21.pdf).","TITLE: page-21.pdf, CONTENT: A

Bering Streets
Arctic Ocean

Winds from the northeast pushed sea ice southward and formed cloud streets—parallel rows of clouds—over the Bering Strait in 

January 2010. The easternmost reaches of Russia, blanketed in snow and ice, appear in the upper left. To the east, sea ice spans 

the Bering Strait. Along the southern edge of the ice, wavy tendrils of newly formed, thin sea ice predominate.

The cloud streets run in the direction of the northerly wind that helps form them. When wind blows out from a cold surface like sea 

ice over the warmer, moister air near the open ocean, cylinders of spinning air may develop. Clouds form along the upward cycle in 

the cylinders, where air is rising, and skies remain clear along the downward cycle, where air is falling. The cloud streets run toward 

the southwest in this image from the Terra satellite.=================

Tracing the Coast
China

The ocean does not heat up as much throughout a day as landmasses do. For this reason, cool, moist marine air commonly gives 

rise to dense clouds over the ocean. 

In this example from the coast of China, an onshore wind carries the clouds from the ocean toward the land. But the land is warmer, 

drier, and unfavorable for cloud growth. As a result, the marine clouds that move onshore tend to evaporate, leaving a cloud layer 

that traces the coastline.=================

Making Tracks
Pacific Ocean

Ships steaming across the Pacific Ocean left this cluster of bright cloud trails lingering in the atmosphere in February 2012. The 

narrow clouds, known as ship tracks, form when water vapor condenses around tiny particles of pollution from ship exhaust. The 

crisscrossing clouds off the coast of California stretched for many hundreds of kilometers from end to end. The narrow ends of the 

clouds are youngest, while the broader, wavier ends are older.

Some of the pollution particles generated by ships (especially sulfates) are soluble in water and can serve as the seeds around which 

cloud droplets form. Clouds infused with ship exhaust have more and smaller droplets than unpolluted clouds. As a result, light 

hitting the ship tracks scatters in many directions, often making them appear brighter than other types of marine clouds, which are 

usually seeded by larger, naturally occurring particles like sea salt.","Coastal weather patterns influence cloud formation over the Bering Strait by the interaction of winds and temperature differences. In January 2010, winds from the northeast pushed sea ice southward, forming cloud streets—parallel rows of clouds—over the Bering Strait.

"How do cloud formation processes differ between the tropical rainforests of Madagascar and the coast of China, considering the impact of land and ocean temperatures?","- In the tropical rainforests of Madagascar, ample moisture enables cloud formation over land due to sunlight heating the land, causing moist air to rise, cool, and condense into clouds. Clouds form where the air is ascending over land (Mania River).
  
- On the coast of China, the ocean does not heat up as much as land, resulting in cool, moist marine air generating dense clouds over the ocean. Onshore winds carry these clouds toward the land, but they tend to evaporate over the warmer, drier land, leaving a cloud layer that traces the coastline.

The primary difference is that Madagascar's land temperatures promote cloud formation through rising moist air, while China's cooler oceanic conditions produce clouds that evaporate upon reaching the warmer land.","TITLE: page-45.pdf, CONTENT: A

Lofted Over Land
Madagascar

Along the muddy Mania River, midday clouds form over the forested land but not the water. In the tropical rainforests of Madagascar, 

there is ample moisture for cloud formation. Sunlight heats the land all day, warming that moist air and causing it to rise high into the 

atmosphere until it cools and condenses into water droplets. Clouds generally form where air is ascending (over land in this case), 

but not where it is descending (over the river). Landsat 8 acquired this image in January 2015.=================

Riding the Waves
Mauritania

You cannot see it directly, but air masses from Africa and the Atlantic Ocean are colliding in this Landsat 8 image from August 2016. 

The collision off the coast of Mauritania produces a wave structure in the atmosphere. 

Called an undular bore or solitary wave, this cloud formation was created by the interaction between cool, dry air coming off the 

continent and running into warm, moist air over the ocean. The winds blowing out from the land push a wave of air ahead like a  

bow wave moving ahead of a boat. 

Parts of these waves are favorable for cloud formation, while other parts are not. The dust blowing out from Africa appears to be 

riding these waves. Dust has been known to affect cloud growth, but it probably has little to do with the cloud pattern observed here.","Cloud formation processes differ significantly between the tropical rainforests of Madagascar and the coast of China due to the varying temperatures of land and ocean.

Framing an Iceberg
South Atlantic Ocean

In June 2016, the Suomi NPP satellite captured this image of various cloud formations in the South Atlantic Ocean. Note how low 

stratus clouds framed a hole over iceberg A-56 as it drifted across the sea. 

The exact reason for the hole in the clouds is somewhat of a mystery. It could have formed by chance, although imagery from the 

days before and after this date suggest something else was at work. It could be that the relatively unobstructed path of the clouds 

over the ocean surface was interrupted by thermal instability created by the iceberg. In other words, if an obstacle is big enough,  

it can divert the low-level atmospheric flow of air around it, a phenomenon often caused by islands.=================

The uninhabited South Sandwich Islands include several active stratovolcanoes. Due to their remote location, these volcanoes  

are some of the least studied in the world, though satellites often catch them erupting. 

The combination of clouds and ice at these latitudes can make it difficult to see plumes of volcanic ash in natural-color imagery. 

But using portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are typically invisible to the naked eye (such as infrared) enables satellites 

to distinguish ice from ash and clouds. The Aqua satellite captured this false-color image in September 2016. Note the three bright 

white plumes running down the middle third of the page; they are warmer and brighter in infrared than the cooler ice clouds (teal) 

around them.

Researchers have learned that even small eruptions like this can affect cloud cover and weather. The tiny solid and liquid particles

Holuhraun Lava Field
Iceland

As an island in the moist, turbulent North Atlantic, Iceland is often shrouded in clouds and difficult to observe from space. In 2014, 

the island started making some of its own cloud cover, as the Earth split open between the Bárðarbunga and Askja volcanoes and 

spewed lava and hot gas. 

Landsat 8 captured this view of the eruption in September 2014. The false-color image combines shortwave infrared, near-infrared, 

and green light. Ice and the plume of steam and sulfur dioxide appear cyan and bright blue, while liquid water is navy blue. Bare or 

rocky ground around the Holuhraun lava field appears in shades of green or brown, and fresh lava is bright orange. Offshore clouds 

appear in bright cyan.

Infrared imagery can help scientists estimate the rate at which lava is pouring out of Earth, as well as the sulfur dioxide content of 

the plume. It also helps them pinpoint lava flows and model how the eruption evolved.","In the South Atlantic Ocean, the Suomi NPP satellite captured an image showing low stratus clouds framing a hole over iceberg A-56, suggesting that the iceberg may have created thermal instability that interrupted the atmospheric flow.

A Glorious View
Pacific Ocean

A layer of stratocumulus clouds over the Pacific Ocean serves as the backdrop for this rainbow-like phenomenon known as a glory. 

Glories form when water droplets within clouds scatter sunlight back toward a source of illumination (in this case, the Sun). 

Although glories may look similar to rainbows, the way light is scattered to produce them is different. Rainbows are formed by 

refraction and reflection; glories are formed by backward diffraction. From the ground or from an airplane, glories appear as circular 

rings of color. In this image, however, the glory is stretched vertically because of how the imager scans the surface in swaths.

Note, too, the swirling von Kármán vortices visible to the right of the glory. The alternating rows of vortices form as air masses run 

into an obstacle—the island of Guadalupe—and form a wake behind it.=================

Storms Stir Up Sediment
Bermuda

In October 2014, the eye of Hurricane Gonzalo passed right over Bermuda. In the process, the potent storm stirred up the sediments 

in the shallow bays and lagoons around the island, spreading a huge mass of sediment across the North Atlantic Ocean. This 

Landsat 8 image shows the area after Gonzalo passed through.

The suspended sediments were likely a combination of beach sand and carbonate sediments from around the shallows and reefs. 

Coral reefs can produce large amounts of calcium carbonate, which stays on the reef flats (where there are coralline algae that also 

produce carbonate) and builds up over time to form islands.

Storm-induced export of carbonates into the deep ocean—where they mostly dissolve—is one of the ways that the oceans naturally 

balance the addition of atmospheric carbon dioxide to ocean waters.=================

The exact reason for the hole in the clouds is somewhat of a mystery. It could have formed by chance, although imagery from the 

days before and after this date suggest something else was at work. It could be that the relatively unobstructed path of the clouds 

over the ocean surface was interrupted by thermal instability created by the iceberg. In other words, if an obstacle is big enough,  

it can divert the low-level atmospheric flow of air around it, a phenomenon often caused by islands.=================

Four Mountains Stand Out
Pacific Ocean

They are called the Islands of the Four Mountains. Part of the Aleutian Island chain, these peaks are actually the upper slopes of 

volcanoes rising from the seafloor: Carlisle, Cleveland, Herbert, and Tana. Standing in one of the most remote reaches of the world, 

these volcanoes have scarcely been studied. Satellite sensing makes that easier, as this Landsat 8 image from June 2013 shows.

Herbert Island (right) is dominated by a symmetrical stratovolcano that stands in its center. The remote island has scarcely been 

studied, and there are no records of eruptions there. The 2-kilometer-wide summit caldera include a lake of meltwater, remnants of 

the snow that covers the peak for most of the year. The straight-down (nadir) satellite view can make it difficult to determine which 

part of the landscape stands taller than the other, a phenomenon known as relief inversion.

On the next page, you can see how a layer of low clouds and fog obscures the lower elevations of the islands and the sea surface. 

But these clouds also hint at the complicated airflow patterns around and through the islands.","The Aqua satellite contributed to understanding the impact of volcanic eruptions on cloud formation in the South Atlantic Ocean by capturing false-color images that distinguish between ice, ash, and clouds using portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are typically invisible to the naked eye. This capability allowed researchers to observe the three bright white plumes from volcanic eruptions, which are warmer and brighter in infrared than the cooler ice clouds surrounding them. These observations revealed that even small eruptions can affect cloud cover and weather, as the aerosols in the plume act as seeds for the formation of cloud droplets.",5,5,The RESPONSE is fully grounded as it accurately conveys all essential information from the CONTEXT without introducing unsupported details or omitting critical points.,pass,3,2,2,"The context contains some relevant information about the Aqua satellite and its observations of volcanic eruptions, but it lacks depth and does not fully address the query.
